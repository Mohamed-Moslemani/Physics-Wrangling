## 🌠 Project Overview

**Physics-Wrangling** is a growing collection of Python scripts focused on tackling a variety of physics problems. From mechanics to electromagnetism and beyond, each project brings a unique area of physics into a programmable form, allowing for easy experimentation and visualization.

## 🔬 Contents

Some of the exciting physics concepts you’ll find in this repository include:

- **Kinematics**: Motion, velocity, acceleration – everything to study how objects move.
- **Dynamics**: Force, energy, momentum – understanding the cause behind motion.
- **Electromagnetism**: Electric fields, magnetic fields, and their applications.
- **Optics**: Light behavior, lenses, and reflection.

...and more to come as the project grows!

## 🎢 Features

- **Interactive Simulations**: Change parameters, rerun simulations, and see the impact on the results.
- **Adaptable Code**: Designed to be modular, so you can easily tweak settings or apply concepts to other problems.
- **Educational Focus**: Learn the physics while diving into the code – with comments and explanations along the way.
